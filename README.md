I'm excited to share my First project where `I delved into the Candidates of India General Election 2019 dataset using exploratory data analysis (#EDA).`
With the assistance of #JupyterNotebook and Python, I conducted a thorough #analysis and discovered some captivating insights. 
Here are the key features I identified:

1. `Seat Sharing`: I examined the distribution of seats among different candidates to understand how they were shared.

2. `Age Distribution`: I explored the age distribution of both contested candidates and winners, shedding light on the demographics of successful candidates.

3. `Average Age Distribution`: Calculating the average age of all candidates helped me get a clearer picture of the overall age distribution in the election.

4. `Gender Ratio`: By analyzing the gender distribution among candidates, I gained insights into the representation of different genders in the elections.

5. `Each Party's Statewise Performance Report in 2019 Election`: I analyzed how each political party performed in different states during the 2019 election,
    providing an overview of their seat shares in various regions.

6. `Ratio Between Participants and Winners Based on Categories`: I investigated how different categories, such as age groups, genders, or education levels,
   influenced the chances of winning in the election.

8. `Political Parties Participation in Terms of States and Number of Constituencies`: I explored the extent of each political party's participation, including the states they contested in and the number of constituencies they fielded candidates in.

19. `Correlation Between Columns`: I examined potential relationships between various columns to uncover any interesting patterns or connections in the data.
   Excitingly, my next step is to build a machine learning model that can predict winning candidates in their respective constituencies with high accuracy.
   I'll be sharing this next notebook with all of you soon.

This project has been an amazing opportunity to enhance my data analysis skills, and I'm eager to continue exploring the realms of EDA and ML to unearth even more insights in my future work.
